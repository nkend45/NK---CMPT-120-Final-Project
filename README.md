This project is a simulation of an ATM. It contains a text file with the name of the account, the account number, the pin number and the balance of the account. 
The user is prompted at first to enter the account number. 
When a correct account number is entered, the window changes for the user to enter a pin. 
If the pin is correct then a new window appears that is the main page of the ATM where the user can deposit, withdraw, check their balance, or quit the program.
